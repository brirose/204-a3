```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```


```{r}
gas <- read_csv(here("HW3_data.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()

gas_price <- 3 #$/gal
carbon_cost <- 51 # $/metric ton

```

Consumers can be separated into two income groups: "high" and "low." The data set provides
price (in $) and quantity (in gallons) estimates of demand per day for the two groups. Run
linear regressions (with an intercept) to estimate the demand curves for "high" and "low"
income consumers.
-Initially, there is no tax on gasoline.
-The current gas price (without any taxes) is $3.00 per gallon.
-The marginal cost of producing a gallon of gasoline is linear and has a price-intercept of 0.
For the purposes of this exercise, you can assume that the US is self-contained in supply and
demand (you don't need to worry about global markets).
